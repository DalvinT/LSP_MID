The UserFitness class has low cohesion if it tries to manage too many unrelated activities within the same class. For example, if it tracks activities, handles nutrition, and manages user personal data all within a single class, it lacks focus and is doing more than one thing. A class should ideally have a single responsibility (the Single Responsibility Principle), and when it doesnâ€™t, it suffers from low cohesion.
