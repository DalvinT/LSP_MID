No, the BankAccount class is not well-encapsulated because its fields (accountHolderName, accountNumber, balance, and interestRate) are public, which allows direct access to the data, violating the principle of encapsulation. To fix this, you should make the fields private and provide getter and setter methods:
public class BankAccount {
    private String accountHolderName;
    private String accountNumber;
    private double balance;
    private double interestRate;

    // Constructor and methods remain the same
    public String getAccountHolderName() {
        return accountHolderName;
    }
    public void setAccountHolderName(String name) {
        this.accountHolderName = name;
    }
    // Other getters and setters
}
