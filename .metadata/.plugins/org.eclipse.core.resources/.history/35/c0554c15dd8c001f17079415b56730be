a)If the Car class hardcodes the trim levels or engine type, it cannot dynamically change them. The current setup seems to lack flexibility for changing trim levels or engines.
b)To allow dynamic trim-level and engine changes, you should refactor Car to use composition:
public class Car {
    private TrimLevel trimLevel;
    private Engine engine;

    public void setTrimLevel(TrimLevel trimLevel) {
        this.trimLevel = trimLevel;
    }

    public void setEngine(Engine engine) {
        this.engine = engine;
    }
}

// TrimLevel and Engine can be separate classes with specific behaviors
